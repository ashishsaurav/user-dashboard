# Quick Fix Summary

## ✅ All Issues Fixed!

### 1. Edit Report/Widget - Role Assignment ✅

**What Changed:**
- Edit modals now properly save role assignments to backend
- Shows current role assignments when opening edit
- Changes to role checkboxes are persisted

**How to Test:**
1. Open "All Reports & Widgets" tab
2. Click edit (✏️) on any report
3. Check/uncheck "User" or "Viewer" roles
4. Click "Save Changes"
5. Open "User Role Permissions" tab
6. Verify the report shows in the roles you selected

### 2. Delete with Foreign Key Fix ✅

**What Changed:**
- Deleting reports/widgets now works without errors
- System automatically cleans up role assignments before deleting

**How to Test:**

2. Go to "All Reports & Widgets" tab
3. Click delete (🗑️) on the report
4. Confirm deletion
5. ✅ No foreign key constraint error!

### 3. widgetType Removed ✅

**What Changed:**
- Frontend no longer sends `widgetType` to backend
- Simplified widget creation/update

**Backend Action Required:**
⚠️ Optional: Update backend to remove widgetType from:
- `WidgetDto` class
- `CreateWidgetDto` class
- `WidgetsController` methods

**Not critical** - backend can keep field for backward compatibility

---

### 4. Add Report/Widget - Role Selection ✅

**What Changed:**
- Can now select roles when creating reports/widgets
- Admin role is always selected (locked)
- Roles are assigned immediately after creation

**How to Test:**
1. Go to "Add Report & Widget" tab
2. Fill in name and URL
3. Select "User" and "Viewer" roles (Admin is always selected)
4. Click the + button
5. Go to "User Role Permissions" tab
6. Verify the new report shows in all selected roles
