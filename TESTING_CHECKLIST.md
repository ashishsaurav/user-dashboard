# PowerBI Layout Change Testing Checklist

## Overview
This checklist verifies that PowerBI reports and visuals **do not reload** during layout operations.

## Expected Behavior
- ‚úÖ PowerBI content should appear **instantly** when layout changes
- ‚úÖ No loading spinner should appear
- ‚úÖ No white flash or blank screen
- ‚úÖ Console should show "Transferred iframe to new container" message
- ‚úÖ PowerBI state (filters, selections, scroll position) should be preserved

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Layout Mode Changes
- [ ] **Change to Horizontal Layout**
  1. Open a view with reports
  2. Change layout mode from vertical to horizontal
  3. ‚úÖ Reports should stay loaded, no reload

  4. ‚úÖ Widgets should appear instantly from cache

### 4. RC-Dock Operations
- [ ] **Drag Panel to Different Position**
  1. Open a view with reports
  2. Drag Reports panel to a different dock position
  3. ‚úÖ Reports should remain loaded during drag
  
- [ ] **Float Panel as Window**
  1. Right-click on panel tab
  2. Select "Float" (if available)
  3. ‚úÖ Reports should remain loaded when floated
  
- [ ] **Dock Floating Panel**

  5. ‚úÖ Reports should still be loaded
  
- [ ] **Switch Between Views** (SHOULD reload - different content)
  1. Open View A with specific reports
  2. Switch to View B with different reports
  3. ‚úÖ View B reports should load (this is correct behavior)
  4. Switch back to View A
  5. ‚úÖ View A reports should appear from cache (instant)

### 6. Reorder Operations (from previous fix)
- [ ] **Reorder Reports**
  1. Open a view with multiple reports
  2. Drag a report to reorder it
  3. ‚úÖ Reports should NOT reload during reorder
  
- [ ] **Reorder Widgets**
  1. Open a view with multiple widgets
  2. Drag a widget to reorder it
  3. ‚úÖ Widgets should NOT reload during reorder

### 7. Resize Operations
- [ ] **Resize Panel Width**
  1. Open a view with reports
  2. Drag the divider to resize panel width
  3. ‚úÖ Reports should remain loaded
  
- [ ] **Resize Panel Height**
  1. In horizontal layout
  2. Drag divider to resize panel height
  3. ‚úÖ Reports should remain loaded

### 8. Multiple Reports Scenario
- [ ] **Multiple Reports in Same View**
  1. Open a view with 3+ reports
  2. Maximize the Reports panel
  3. ‚úÖ All reports should remain loaded
  4. Restore the panel
  5. ‚úÖ All reports should still be loaded
  
- [ ] **Switch Active Report Tab**
  1. Open a view with multiple reports
  2. Click between report tabs
  3. ‚úÖ Each report should appear instantly (cached)

### 9. Edge Cases
- [ ] **Rapid Layout Changes**
  1. Quickly toggle between horizontal/vertical several times
  2. ‚úÖ Reports should remain stable, no reloads
  
- [ ] **Multiple Maximize/Restore Cycles**
  1. Maximize Reports panel
  2. Restore it
  3. Maximize again
  4. Restore again
  5. ‚úÖ Reports should never reload
  
- [ ] **Complex Layout Manipulation**
  1. Start with vertical layout
  2. Maximize Reports
  3. Change to horizontal layout (while maximized)
  4. Restore panel
  5. Change back to vertical
  6. ‚úÖ Reports should remain loaded through entire sequence

### 10. Token Refresh Scenario
- [ ] **Long Session (Token Expiry)**
  1. Open a view with reports
  2. Wait for token to near expiration (55 minutes)
  3. Perform layout change
  4. ‚úÖ Report should refresh token silently
  5. ‚úÖ No visible reload

## Console Verification

### Success Messages to Watch For
```
‚úÖ Transferred iframe to new container: report:workspace:report:page
üíæ Detached iframe to hidden container: report:workspace:report:page
‚ôªÔ∏è  Reusing cached PowerBI instance: report:workspace:report:page
```

### Warning Messages (Should NOT appear frequently)
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Iframe missing, re-embedding to new container
‚ö†Ô∏è Transfer failed, will create new embed
```

If you see these warnings, the iframe preservation failed.

## Browser DevTools Verification

### Hidden Container Check
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Run: `document.getElementById('powerbi-detached-container')`
4. ‚úÖ Should exist and contain iframes when panels are unmounted

### Network Tab
1. Open DevTools Network tab
2. Filter for "embed" or PowerBI requests
3. Perform layout changes
4. ‚úÖ Should NOT see new embed token requests (unless token expired)

### Performance Check
1. Open DevTools Performance tab
2. Start recording
3. Perform layout change (e.g., maximize panel)
4. Stop recording
5. ‚úÖ Should see appendChild() operations, NOT iframe creation

## Regression Tests

### Ensure Previous Fixes Still Work
- [ ] **Reorder Reports** (from POWERBI_REORDER_FIX.md)
  - Drag-and-drop reports should not reload
  
- [ ] **Reorder Widgets** (from POWERBI_REORDER_FIX.md)
  - Drag-and-drop widgets should not reload
  
- [ ] **Theme Toggle**
  - Switching between light/dark theme should not reload PowerBI
  
- [ ] **View Selection**
  - Selecting a view should load its content
  - Re-selecting same view should use cache

## Performance Metrics

### Measure Before/After
| Operation | Before Fix | After Fix | Target |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Maximize panel | 2-5s reload | <50ms | <100ms |
| Layout mode change | 2-5s reload | <50ms | <100ms |
| Close/reopen panel | 2-5s reload | <50ms | <100ms |
| Reorder reports | 0ms (fixed) | 0ms | 0ms |

## Known Issues / Limitations

### Expected Behavior
- **Switching views**: WILL reload (different content) - This is correct
- **First load**: WILL show loading spinner - This is correct
- **Network error**: MAY reload if token fetch fails - This is correct

### Not Covered by This Fix
- Page navigation within PowerBI report (handled by PowerBI SDK)
- PowerBI refresh button (user-initiated reload)
- PowerBI error recovery (automatic retry)

## Debugging Failed Tests

### If Reports Still Reload

1. **Check Console for iframe Transfer Messages**
   - Should see "Transferred iframe to new container"
   - If you see "Iframe missing, re-embedding", the transfer failed

2. **Check Hidden Container**
   ```javascript
   // In console
   document.getElementById('powerbi-detached-container').children.length
   ```
   - Should be 0 when all panels are visible
   - Should increase when panels unmount

3. **Check Registry State**
   - Look for "Detached iframe to hidden container" messages
   - Verify cleanup is called on unmount

4. **Verify React.memo Still Active**
   - Check for "PowerBIEmbedReport RENDER" messages
   - Should only see on props change, not layout change

### Common Issues

1. **Browser Extension Interference**
   - Disable ad blockers and test again
   
2. **React StrictMode Double-Mount**
   - This is expected in development, won't happen in production
   
3. **Concurrent Layout Changes**
   - Rapid changes might queue multiple transfers
   - Should still work, just slower

## Sign-Off

- [ ] All test scenarios passed
- [ ] Console shows expected messages
- [ ] No unexpected reloads observed
- [ ] Performance meets targets
