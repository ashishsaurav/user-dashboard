## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Role Permissions tab is empty"

**Check:**
- Are you logged in as admin?
- Check browser console for API errors

- Test endpoint: `GET https://localhost:7273/api/Reports`

**Fix:**
- Component only works for admin users
- Non-admin will see error message

---

### Issue: "Changes not saving"

**Check:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Check Network tab for failed requests
- Verify backend endpoints exist
- Check API endpoint URLs (capital letters)

**Fix:**
- Ensure backend is running
- Check endpoint casing: `/api/Reports/` not `/api/reports/`
