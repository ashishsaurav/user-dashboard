## 🔴 Critical Findings (Immediate Action Required)

### Security Score: 3/10 ⚠️

**Top 4 Critical Issues:**

2. **No Authorization** - Users can access other users' data
3. **Insecure CORS** - AllowAnyOrigin() is dangerous
4. **Hardcoded Credentials** - Database password in source code

**Impact:** 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Do not deploy to production without fixes

**Fix Timeline:** 1-2 weeks (See SECURITY_FIX_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md)
